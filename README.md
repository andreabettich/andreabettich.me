This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How To

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`
Installes all needed dependencies. Go grab a coffee, this could take some time.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the JS or also the SASS files.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
